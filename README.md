# MT-Elektro.rs | current version

https://www.mt-elektro.rs/

For anyone who doesn't understand the language of the page, this is a page about white goods service (Appliance services) in Serbia in places in and around Belgrade.
After 10 years of experience in service giving, my friend started running his own company, I hope that he will work successfully and that this site will help him to reach more people around. 😊

The main goal was to keep everything simple and effective. Without almost any animations, and with larger size of font.

This is the recreated site after finishing my second course on Udemy.

Also, I haven't learned php yet, so the mail form is not perfect (not yet) 😁  
Currently, I'm learning javaScript, and I confess that i made a (currently good working) mess in this script.js file..
